<p align="center"><b><i>A web-based SDR toolkit for analyzing, processing, and sharing RF recordings</i></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><i>ðŸ”ŽTry it out at <a href="https://iqengine.org">iqengine.org</a>ðŸ”Ž</i></b></p>

IQEngine is a web application that powers <a href="https://iqengine.org">iqengine.org</a> but can also be deployed as a private instance to share recordings within a company/organization.  The public instance, <a href="https://iqengine.org">iqengine.org</a>, is used by thousands each month to browse RF recordings shared by the community, although you can also use the site to visualize your own local files (processing is done client-side).  It includes a spectrogram-based visualization and editor tool, built on top of the [SigMF](https://github.com/gnuradio/SigMF) standard.  Use IQEngine to expand your knowledge of wireless signals and how to analyze/process them, while learning more about FFTs, filtering, and other RF DSP.  IQEngine's goal is to bring the open-source RF community together.

IQEngine is rapidly evolving, so [sign up](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/299501/77960409531811734/share) for a once-a-month email update, including new features, demos, and more!  There is also an IQEngine [Discord](https://discord.gg/k7C8kp3b76) chat channel if you want to get involved in the development or have questions.

[Link to the live docs](https://staging.iqengine.org/docs) which can also be found in the source code at `client/src/pages/docs/***.mdx`

### List of Major Features:

* Spectrogram + time + freq + IQ plots with zooming and adjustable scales
* Table of all RF recordings available in a directory or blob storage account, with spectrogram thumbnails
* FIR filtering and arbitrary Python snippets prior to FFT, all client-side
* Time and frequency domain selection cursors to choose what gets sent to plots/plugins/downloads
* Configurable colormap
* Viewable/editable global params and annotations, including adding a new annotation graphically or through text
* Jump to annotation when you click it from the table
* Plugins, allowing DSP to run on the backend (currently supports Python and GNU Radio)
* Ability to search/query over millions of recordings by parsing metadata into database
* User/admin system for controlling access to certain recordings
* The IQEngine team created a new web library for performing FFTs and related functions, called [WebFFT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webfft), you can play with it using the [demo here](https://webfft.com/)
