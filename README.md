<h4 style="text-align: center;"><i>A web-based SDR toolkit for analyzing, processing, and sharing RF recordings</i></h4>

* Spectrogram-based visualization and editor tool, built on SigMF
* Share your RF recordings or RFML datasets with others, without them having to download files or install any software
* IQEngine only fetches the portion of the samples you're viewing, allowing you to quickly browse very large RF recordings
* Test signal detection algorithms and visualize results
* Interactively learn about Fourier transforms and filters by applying them to interesting signals
* Organize and search through millions of RF recordings via metadata queries

Try IQEngine now using the canonical instance at [www.iqengine.org](http://iqengine.org/) hosted by [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) and connected to the official [SigMF](https://github.com/gnuradio/SigMF) examples repository.  You can use the same site to open local RF recordings, the processing is all done client-side.

IQEngine is rapidly evolving, so [sign up](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/299501/77960409531811734/share) for a once-a-month email update, including new features, demos, and more!  There is also an IQEngine [Discord](https://discord.gg/k7C8kp3b76) chat channel if you want to get involved in the development or have questions.

## List of Major Features:

* Spectrogram + time + freq + IQ plots with zooming and adjustable scales
* Table of all RF recordings available in a directory or blob storage account, with spectrogram thumbnails
* FIR filtering and arbitrary Python snippets prior to FFT, all client-side
* Time and frequency domain selection cursors to choose what gets sent to plots/plugins/downloads
* Configurable colormap
* Viewable/editable global params and annotations, including adding a new annotation graphically or through text
* Jump to annotation when you click it from the table
* Plugins, allowing DSP to run on the backend (currently supports Python and GNU Radio)
* Ability to search/query over millions of recordings by parsing metadata into database
* User/admin system for controlling access to certain recordings
* The IQEngine team is currently creating a new web library for performing FFTs and related functions, called [WebFFT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webfft), you can play with it using the [demo here](https://webfft.com/)
