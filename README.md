<h4 style="text-align: center;"><i>A web-based SDR toolkit for analyzing, processing, and sharing RF recordings</i></h4>

* Spectrogram-based visualization and editor tool, built on SigMF
* Share your RF recordings or RFML datasets with others, without them having to download files or install any software
* IQEngine only fetches the portion of the samples you're viewing, allowing you to quickly browse very large RF recordings
* Test signal detection algorithms and visualize results
* Interactively learn about Fourier transforms and filters by applying them to interesting signals
* Organize and search through millions of RF recordings via metadata queries

Try IQEngine now using the canonical instance at [www.iqengine.org](http://iqengine.org/) hosted by [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) and connected to the official [SigMF](https://github.com/gnuradio/SigMF) examples repository.  You can use the same site to open local RF recordings, the processing is all done client-side.

IQEngine is rapidly evolving, so [sign up](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/299501/77960409531811734/share) for a once-a-month email update, including new features, demos, and more!  There is also an IQEngine [Discord](https://discord.gg/k7C8kp3b76) chat channel if you want to get involved in the development or have questions.

## Plugins

IQEngine supports a plugin system, allowing DSP and other functions to run at the backend and process IQ samples.  Running a plugin occurs on the spectrogram page, after selecting the portion of the recording you want to process.  One example use-case is running a signal detector (with optional classifier), which will display the output annotations as soon as it finishes, convenient for testing new detection/classification algorithms.  It is also possible to wrap a GNU Radio flowgraph into a plugin; it must run in no-GUI mode and use ZMQ PUB/SUB for the input and output streams.

## Running IQEngine

For 99% of users, there is no reason to run your own instance of IQEngine; the canonical instance at [www.iqengine.org](http://www.iqengine.org) can be used to view local files or access your private storage account.  Organizations who wish to run their own instance for internal use can click the button below to deploy an instance of IQEngine in Azure.  You will need an Azure account, but you can get a free one [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).  The deployment will take about 5 minutes.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FIQEngine%2FIQEngine%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fiqengine.json)

For developers, or anyone who wants to run their own instance locally, use one of the three methods below:

### Using the Public Docker Image

You can run the latest Docker image from the GitHub repository by executing the following command after [installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/):

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d ghcr.io/iqengine/iqengine:latest
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to run the latest pre-release version from the "main" branch:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d ghcr.io/iqengine/iqengine:pre
```

This command will launch IQEngine, and you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Running from Source Code

To run IQEngine from source code, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
If you don't have them, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Additionally, ensure that you have Python 3.10 or a higher version installed.
You can download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Lastly, you'll need to have "make" installed on your system, which can be obtained from [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

Once you have Node.js, npm, Python, and make installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
make setup
```

3. Start the development server by executing the following command:

```bash
make dev
```

After executing these commands, all the dependencies will be installed, and the development server will start. You can access IQEngine at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Running from a Local Docker Build Image

If you prefer to build and run the IQEngine Docker image locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Build the Docker image by executing the following command:

```bash
docker build -t iqengine-local .
```

3. Once the image is built successfully, run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d iqengine-local
```

This will instantiate IQEngine using your locally built Docker image, and you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project Configuration

To configure the project, you need to set specific environment variables. The currently supported environment variables are as follows:

* `IQENGINE_CONNECTION_INFO`: This variable contains information about the connection string and data sources. You can refer to the [example.env](example.env) file for an example.

* `IQENGINE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY`: This variable holds the key for Google Analytics. If you don't intend to use Google Analytics, you can leave this variable empty.

* `IQENGINE_PLUGINS`: Use this variable to specify the plugins you want to use it needs to be an array of objects with the following properties: name, url. The name is the name of the plugin and the url is the url to the plugin. ex: IQENGINE_PLUGINS = [{"name": "My Plugin", "url": "http://localhost:3000"}]

* `IQENGINE_FEATURE_FLAGS`: Use this variable to specify feature flags for the web app. If you have a Metadata database you can specify the `useAPIDatasources` flag like this: IQENGINE_FEATURE_FLAGS = {"useAPIDatasources": false}. Additional feature flags can be added using comma separation.

* `IQENGINE_METADATA_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`: This variable stores the connection string for the Metadata DB. If you don't want to utilize the Metadata DB, you can leave this variable empty. Please note that this variable is only used by the backend API.

* `IN_MEMORY_DB`: This variable switches in-memory DB on or off. The in-memory DB is intended for testing only. Use IN_MEMORY_DB = 0 for off and 1 for on. PyTest tests of the API make use of the in-memory DB.

* `IQENGINE_APP_ID` = For your administrative user, it is crucial to set up this variable. Create a registration app dedicated to the administrative user within your application. This variable is necessary to enable their login functionality. Remember to include your website's redirect URI as a Single Page Application (SPA) redirect. The redirect should consist of your site's URL followed by "/admin.".

* `IQENGINE_APP_AUTHORITY`: This is the authority for your application that will login to the third party provider.

## Feature Flags

We have several feature flags currently in use. Their purposes are as follows:

* `useIQEngineOutReach`: When true this flag shows IQ Engine outreach links, specifically the Discord and the link to sign up for the monthly IQ Engine email. This is true as default.

* `useAPIDatasources`: When true this flag allows the use and display of API data sources in the RepoBrowser component. This is true as default.

* `displayIQEngineGitHub`: When true this flag shows the link for the IQ Engine GitHub repo. This is true as default.

* `displayInternalBranding`: When true this flag displays an additional logo for customers using IQ Engine. This is false as default.

### Misc Developer Tips

To fix 99% of linting warnings automatically, try running:

```bash
docker run -d -v $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel):/tmp/lint ghcr.io/oxsecurity/megalinter:v6
```

Feature flags are set up across the application. To use a feature flag, add it to your .env file in the root of the repo and then use it to wrap UI elements as illustrated below, or use the getFeatureFlag(flagname) method to programmatically get a feature flag value.

Each component needs to import the Feature component.

```HTML
      <Feature flag="useIQEngineOutReach">
        <h2 className="text-center py-2">
          Sign up for a once-a-month email update on IQEngine, such as new features, demos, and more!
        </h2>
      </Feature>
```

Azure Container App Config Notes:

* Within the GitHub repository settings under Secrets and vars > Actions, there needs to be a Repository secret with AZUREAPPSERVICE_PUBLISHPROFILE...
* Connection settings live in GitHub Secrets > Actions (not Azure App Service anymore), enter it in without the outer double quotes and don't escape any quotes.
