# Plugins

Through a separate backend API, IQEngine supports various plugins, which act as RF functions you can run on sets of IQ samples.
This plugins take in IQ samples, and output either IQ samples or another format, such as bytes, audio, SigMF annotations, etc.
While it is expected that most plugins will take in 1 set of IQ samples, it is possible to provide a set of IQ samples, such as for TDOA or MIMO processing.
Some example plugins we expect to support (using the same plugins API for all) include:

- Signal detectors
- Signal and modulation classifiers
- Modems (demodulation, decoding, etc)
- Filters
- Channel emulators
- Radar
- TDOA
- DOA
- MIMO processing
- Signal generators (the one case that wont take in IQ)

Plugins written in Python can make use of the existing Python plugin server in the /src directory and authors can start from the template plugin.
We expect to create a C++ version of this server and template plugin soon.
Plugins written in other languages will have to implement the full API.

To get a feel for how simple it is to write a Python based plugin, check out the /src/lowpass_filter/low_passfilter.py
code that implements a low-pass filter plugin in a couple dozen lines of Python, no additional boilerplate needed!

## To run FastAPI functions locally for testing:

First edit your .env file to include `VITE_PLUGINS_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/plugins/`

```
sudo apt install uvicorn ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6 -y
cd plugins
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn plugins_api:app --reload
```

IQEngine is currently set up to use <http://127.0.0.1:8000/plugins/> as the plugins endpoint so as long as your uvicorn chose port 8000 you should be able to go to www.iqengine.org or run the webapp locally and using the plugins menu will hit your locally running plugins app.

To run the example call, install the vscode extension called "REST Client" then when you open the .http file there should be a "send request" button

The way it works is the plugin name must match the directory and .py file within that directory, for fastapi to see it (e.g. markos_detector/markos_detector.py).

See the template_plugin for how the input and outputs of the function work, if you want to create your own plugin.

## Notes

When deploying with Azure remember to go into the function apps Configuration and under Application Settings there needs to be one for AzureWebJobsStorage which is the storage account connection string, as well as MongoDBConnString

To set up certs, configure the DNS name for the VM (under Overview) then fill out "DNS name label" to get a xxx.cloudapp.azure.com domain, then follow these instructions <https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&os=ubuntufocal>.  Certs get saved in /etc/letsencrypt/live/xxx so the new uvicorn command is:
```
sudo uvicorn plugins_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --ssl-keyfile=/etc/letsencrypt/live/iqengine-detector.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com/privkey.pem --ssl-certfile=/etc/letsencrypt/live/iqengine-detector.eastus2.cloudapp.azure.com/fullchain.pem
```
