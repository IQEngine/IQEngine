# sdriq2sigmf Readme

## Introduction

`sdriq2sigmf` is a Python script designed to convert SDRIQ files generated by SDRangel into SIGMF (Signal Metadata and Formatting) files. SIGMF is a flexible and extensible file format for storing and exchanging signal datasets, including metadata and sample data. This script provides an efficient way to transform SDRIQ data into the SIGMF format, allowing for easier analysis, sharing, and processing of signal recordings.

## Prerequisites

Before using `sdriq2sigmf`, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* Python 3.x
* Required Python packages (dependencies):
    * numpy

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

The `sdriq2sigmf` script provides a command-line interface for converting SDRIQ files to SIGMF format.

### Command Syntax

```bash
python sdriq2sigmf.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [--do-not-overwrite] path
```

### Arguments

* `path`: Path to the directory containing the SDRIQ files to be converted.

### Options

* `-h`, `--help`: Show the help message and exit.
* `-o OUTPUT`, `--output OUTPUT`: Specify the output directory for the converted SIGMF files (default: current directory).
* `--do-not-overwrite`: Prevent overwriting existing files in the output directory.

### Example Usage

Convert SDRIQ files from the `/path/to/sdriq_files/` directory and save the converted SIGMF files in the `/path/to/output/` directory:

```bash
python sdriq2sigmf.py -o /path/to/output/ /path/to/sdriq_files/
```

By default, the script will overwrite existing files in the output directory. To avoid overwriting, use the `--do-not-overwrite` option.

## SDRIQ File Format

SDRIQ files generated by SDRangel consist of the following header structure:

* Sample rate in samples per second (4 bytes, 32 bits)
* Center frequency in Hertz (8 bytes, 64 bits)
* Start time Unix timestamp epoch in seconds (8 bytes, 64 bits)
* Sample size (16 or 24 bits) (4 bytes, 32 bits)
* Filler with all zeroes (4 bytes, 32 bits)
* CRC32 (IEEE) checksum of the preceding 28 bytes (4 bytes, 32 bits)

## Output Format (SIGMF)

The converted [SIGMF](https://github.com/sigmf/SigMF) files will contain the signal data in SIGMF format, which includes detailed metadata about the signal recording, such as sample rate, center frequency, start time, and more. This format enhances the interoperability and accessibility of the signal data for various applications.

## Conclusion

`sdriq2sigmf` simplifies the process of converting SDRIQ files into the SIGMF format, making it easier to work with and share signal recordings. The script's command-line interface allows for convenient batch conversion and provides options to control the output location and overwriting behavior. By leveraging the power of SIGMF, you can enhance your signal data analysis workflow.
