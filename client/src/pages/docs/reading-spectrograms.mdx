 # How to Read a Spectrogram with IQEngine
 
One of the primary tools in the Radio Frequency (RF) field is the spectrogram, a visual representation of frequencies as they change with time. IQEngine offers an intuitive platform to analyze these spectrograms.
 
## What is a Spectrogram?
 
A spectrogram is a 2D representation that showcases how the frequencies of a signal vary with time. On a spectrogram:
 
- One axis represents time.
- One axis represents frequency.
- The color or intensity signifies the amplitude or strength of a particular frequency at a given time.
 
## Getting Started with IQEngine
 
To begin, navigate to the main IQEngine interface. Here, you can either browse RF recordings shared by the community or upload your own files for analysis. 

1. **Upload or Browse and Select a Recording**
2. **View the Spectrogram**: Once your recording is loaded, IQEngine will display its spectrogram.
 
## Interpreting the Spectrogram
 
### Color Intensity
 
Darker shades (often blues) indicate lower amplitudes, while brighter shades (such as yellows or reds) denote higher amplitudes. This means a bright streak on the spectrogram indicates a strong frequency component at that particular time. You can adjust the maximum color mapping magnitudes when viewing samples using the scrollbar:

### Frequency Patterns
 
Horizontal lines represent steady frequencies over time, often indicating a continuous tone or signal. Wavy or curved lines can signify modulated signals, which are common in communication systems.
 
### Time Evolution
 
Watching how colors change vertically can give insights into how the signal's strength varies with time. Sudden bright bursts can indicate bursts of activity or transmissions.
 
## Adjusting the Spectrogram
---

With IQEngine, you can:
 
- **Zoom and Pan**: This allows for detailed analysis of specific sections of the spectrogram.
- **Annotations**: View SigMF annotations and other metadata directly on the spectrogram for enhanced insights.
- **Plugin Integration**: Enhance your analysis with plugins written in Python, GNU Radio, and more.
