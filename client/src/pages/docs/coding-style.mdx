# Coding Style

## Client folder structure

The organization of the file structure it is heavily inspired by the [Web dev simplified article](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2022-07/react-folder-structure/) on how to structure a React project.

The frontend is organized in the following folders:

- `public`: Contains the static files that are served by the web server.
- `src`: Contains the source code of the frontend.
  - `features`: Contains the features and components that are used across multiple pages.
    - `<feature-name>` Contains the React components that are used to build the feature with the name `<feature name>`.
      - `components`: Contains the React components that are used to build the feature with the name `<feature name>`.
      - `hooks`: Contains the React hooks that are used to build the feature with the name `<feature name>`.
    - `ui`: Contains the React components that are used to build the UI of the app.
  - `pages`: Contains the React components that are used to build the pages of the app.
    - `<page-name>`: Contains the React components that are used to build the page with the name `<page name>`.
      - `components`: Contains the React components that are used to build the page with the name `<page name>`.
      - `hooks`: Contains the React hooks that are used to build the page with the name `<page name>`.
  - `api`: Contains the functions and hooks that are used to make API calls to the backend.
    - `<api-area>`: Contains the functions and hooks that are used to make API calls to the backend for the area `<api-area>`.
    - `utils`: Contains utility functions that are used to make API calls to the backend.
  - `utils`: Contains utility functions that are used throughout the app.
  - `mocks`: Contains mock data and methods that are used for testing.
  - `hooks`: Contains the React hooks that are used throughout the app.
  - `data`: Contains the static data that is used throughout the app.
  - `App.tsx`: The main React component of the app.
  - `index.tsx`: The entry point of the app.

## Client file naming conventions

- All the files are named using `kebab-case`.
- All the folders are named using `kebab-case`.
- All the React components are named using `PascalCase`.
- All the React hooks are named using `usePascalCase`.
- All functions are named using `camelCase`.
- All the variables are named using `camelCase`.
- All the constants are named using `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- All the types are named using `PascalCase`.
- All the interfaces are named using `PascalCase`.
- All the enums are named using `PascalCase`.
