# Overview

For basic usage of IQEngine, reference [IQEngine.org/about](about) and animated gifs.

## Running your own instance of IQEngine

For 99% of users, **there is no reason to run your own instance of IQEngine**;
the canonical instance at [www.iqengine.org](http://www.iqengine.org) can be used to view local files or access your private storage account.
<br />
A developer working on IQEngine should reference the New Dev Guide for how to set up a local instance for development.
<br />
Organizations who wish to run their own instance for internal use can install IQEngine on a server using the [Install with Docker](/docs/install-with-docker) instructions, or alternatively, deploy an instance of IQEngine in Azure [using this link](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FIQEngine%2FIQEngine%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fiqengine.json) (you will need an Azure account; a free one can be created [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)).
<br />

## High level architecture

The IQEngine app can be broken down into the following components:

1. Frontend (a.k.a. client)
2. Backend (a.k.a. api)
3. Plugins server
4. Database
5. Blob storage

Separately, there is the deployment/infrastructure side, which contains services like container apps and an app registration to hold permissions.
<br></br>
The plugins server is intentionally kept as isolated as possible for the sake of security,
as its job is to run plugins which can take any form (can be thought of as arbitrary code).
Plugins are able to access only the IQ from the recording they were triggered to process,
and the interface between the plugins server and client is specified in an OpenAPI spec (see Plugins docs).
<br></br>
The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of IQEngine, not including security/admin oriented features.

## Optimizations for Speed ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

While viewing a signal, it only downloads IQ samples to the client that are being viewed at the time (which caching as much as possible).

To look at a larger region of a signal, when you zoom out, it uses batch decimation so it's not sending 100% of samples, but instead it gives 1 FFT worth of samples then skips N FFTs worth of samples.

Currently IQEngine hosts the webapp and storage container on two separate regions (East US and UK South), with Azure Front Door as the CDN to route traffic to the closest region to each user.

The frontend/backend and plugins server run within Container Apps, and they are set to auto-scale in replicas based on traffic, making sure it can handle any load.
