# New Developer Guide

## Prerequisites

- git
- make
- Python 3.10+

## Basic Setup

To run IQEngine from source, to allow for easily making changes, use the following steps.
Note that Python 3.10 and Node 18 or 20 is required.
Tested on Ubuntu 22 with Python and make already installed, but should work for other debian-based distros as well.
1. Install Node using steps 1-3 here https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions
1. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/IQEngine/IQEngine.git`
1. `cd IQEngine`
1. Within the root directory copy and paste the 'example.env' and rename to '.env', this is where you can configure your deployment
1. To serve recordings stored on your computer, edit .env, and add `IQENGINE_BACKEND_LOCAL_FILEPATH = "/tmp/lte"` or whichever directory you want to serve from
1. (Optional) If you want the GNU Radio example tile to show up, ask an admin on Discord for the .env entry (specifically, IQENGINE_CONNECTION_INFO)
1. From the root directory run the command ```make setup``` (ignore warnings)
1. Open three concurrent terminals for backend, frontend, and plugins
    1. In the **backend** terminal, run `make run-api` to start the backend (uses port 5000)
    1. In the **frontend** terminal, run `make dev` to start the development web server (uses port 3000)
    1. Optionally, in the **plugins** terminal, run `make run-plugins` to start the plugins server (uses port 8000)
1. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to access the site
1. Optionally- if you want to see the public "GNU Radio Repo" recordings, ask Marc for a SAS token which gets used in the .env within IQENGINE_CONNECTION_INFO

## Code Organization

The following diagram shows the basic organization of the repo, with details on how the frontend pages are organized.

### React Query Notes

Everything below is specific to the client code

- In app.tsx we add ReactQueryDevtools, which only gets enabled if its a development environment.
- In index.tsx we create QueryClient, set staleTime/cacheTime for each key, and QueryClientProvider gets passed into every component in the app.
- Within client/src/api/ there are loads of useQuery's, useMutation's, and useQueryClient's
  - api/config - GET/PUT /api/config, and a useMutation for key 'config'
  - api/converter - key 'convertWaveToSigmf', a POST to /api/convert/wav
  - api/datasource - key 'datasource', 'sas', 'metadata-query', includes code for uploading a file via the admin page
  - api/iqdata - includes definition of useGetIQData(), useRawIQData(), useGetMinimapIQ(), clearIQData.  
  - api/metadata - keys 'datasource', 'smart-query', 'track'
  - api/plugin - key 'plugins', GET/POST/DELETE/PUT /api/plugins/\{plugin.name\} 
  - api/user-settings - some defaults like colormap are stored here
  - api/users - key 'users', GET /api/users
- Within api/iqdata there is IQDataClient which only has 2 functions- getIQDataBlocks(), getMinimapIQ(), and then a Factory around it to have different code for API, Blob, and Local storage.
  - getIQDataBlocks() takes in SigMFMetadata, fftsRequired, fftsize, and an AbortSignal.  It returns Promise\<IQDataSlice[]\>, where each IQDataSlice contains an index and a Float32Array
- As far as where the IQ samples are stored, there are 3 different keys:
  - 'iqData' - just the recently fetched raw IQ
  - 'rawiqdata' - all the raw IQ in storage
  - 'processedIQData' - stores the output of applyProcessing() which includes pyodide, filter, squaring.  If any of those things change, or fftsize changes, it recomputes processedIQData, this happens in api/iqdata/Queries.ts
- fftsRequired is currently stored using useState, within api/iqdata/Queries.ts
- As far as zooming out, the current zoom level is stored in fftStepSize and set with setFFTStepSize, in file recording-view/hooks/use-spectrogram-context.tsx
   - Zooming out is done by batch decimating, where the batch size matches the FFT size
   - fftStepSize of 0 means no zooming out, and the samples will be contiguous
   - setFFTStepSize gets called in just one spot, in settings-pane.tsx when the slider is moved
   - fftStepSize is used in several spots including the scollbar, plotting annotations, when calculating requiredFFTIndices (happens in hooks/use-spectrogram.tsx)
- useGetImage is what ultimately creates the 2d RGB bitmap,  

### Misc Developer Tips

To fix 99% of linting warnings automatically, try running:

```bash
docker run -d -v $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel):/tmp/lint ghcr.io/oxsecurity/megalinter:v6
```

Feature flags are set up across the application. To use a feature flag, add it to your .env file in the root of the repo and then use it to wrap UI elements as illustrated below, or use the getFeatureFlag(flagname) method to programmatically get a feature flag value.

Each component needs to import the Feature component, e.g.:

```HTML
      <Feature flag="useIQEngineOutReach">
        <h2 className="text-center py-2">
          Stuff
        </h2>
      </Feature>
```

Azure Container App Config Notes:

* Within the GitHub repository settings under Secrets and vars > Actions, there needs to be a Repository secret with AZUREAPPSERVICE_PUBLISHPROFILE...
* Connection settings live in GitHub Secrets > Actions (not Azure App Service anymore), enter it in without the outer double quotes and don't escape any quotes.
