# New Developer Guide

## Prerequisites

- git
- make
- Python 3.10+

## Basic Setup

To run IQEngine from source, to allow for easily making changes, use the following steps.
Note that Python 3.10 and Node 18 or 20 is required.
Tested on Ubuntu 22 with Python and make already installed, but should work for other debian-based distros as well.
1. Install Node using steps 1-3 here https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions
1. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/IQEngine/IQEngine.git`
1. `cd IQEngine`
1. Within the root directory copy and paste the 'example.env' and rename to '.env', this is where you can configure your deployment
1. To serve recordings stored on your computer, edit .env, and add `IQENGINE_BACKEND_LOCAL_FILEPATH = "/tmp/lte"` or whichever directory you want to serve from
1. (Optional) If you want the GNU Radio example tile to show up, ask an admin on Discord for the .env entry (specifically, IQENGINE_CONNECTION_INFO)
1. From the root directory run the command ```make setup``` (ignore warnings)
1. Open three concurrent terminals for backend, frontend, and plugins
    1. In the **backend** terminal, run `make run-api` to start the backend (uses port 5000)
    1. In the **frontend** terminal, run `make dev` to start the development web server (uses port 3000)
    1. Optionally, in the **plugins** terminal, run `make run-plugins` to start the plugins server (uses port 8000)
1. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to access the site
1. Optionally- if you want to see the public "GNU Radio Repo" recordings, ask Marc for a SAS token which gets used in the .env within IQENGINE_CONNECTION_INFO

## Code Organization

The following diagram shows the basic organization of the repo, with details on how the frontend pages are organized.

## Using the Public Docker Image

Alternatively, you can run the latest Docker image from the GitHub repository by executing the following command after [installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/):
<br />
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d ghcr.io/iqengine/iqengine:latest
```
<br />
Or, if you prefer to run the latest pre-release version from the "main" branch:
<br />
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d ghcr.io/iqengine/iqengine:pre
```
<br />
This command will launch IQEngine, and you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
<br />

### Running from a Local Docker Build Image

If you prefer to build and run the IQEngine Docker image locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory
2. Copy the example.env to .env and edit it to insert anything such as cloud datasources to IQENGINE_CONNECTION_INFO
3. Build the Docker image by executing the following command:

```bash
docker build -t iqengine-local .
```

4. Once the image is built successfully, run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 -d iqengine-local
```
<br />
This will instantiate IQEngine using your locally built Docker image with your local .env file, and you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If the .env file is causing issues, remove the `--env-file .env` from the command above and it should work, just without custom datasources/settings

### Misc Developer Tips

To fix 99% of linting warnings automatically, try running:

```bash
docker run -d -v $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel):/tmp/lint ghcr.io/oxsecurity/megalinter:v6
```

Feature flags are set up across the application. To use a feature flag, add it to your .env file in the root of the repo and then use it to wrap UI elements as illustrated below, or use the getFeatureFlag(flagname) method to programmatically get a feature flag value.

Each component needs to import the Feature component.

```HTML
      <Feature flag="useIQEngineOutReach">
        <h2 className="text-center py-2">
          Sign up for a once-a-month email update on IQEngine, such as new features, demos, and more!
        </h2>
      </Feature>
```

Azure Container App Config Notes:

* Within the GitHub repository settings under Secrets and vars > Actions, there needs to be a Repository secret with AZUREAPPSERVICE_PUBLISHPROFILE...
* Connection settings live in GitHub Secrets > Actions (not Azure App Service anymore), enter it in without the outer double quotes and don't escape any quotes.
