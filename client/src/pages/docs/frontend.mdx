# Frontend (a.k.a. Client)

Use this page for **usage-oriented** docs related to the frontend (aka /client)

This is the frontend for IQEngine. It is a React app that connects to the backend API and it is responsible for the UI and the user experience.

## Building the frontend to create static files

For the normal way to build, see the New Dev Guide.  The following is for advanced users who want to build the frontend in production mode.

To build the frontend, you can run the following commands:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` folder with the static files that can be served by a web server.
