# Record Using an SDR

On this page we provide the steps needed to create a SigMF recording using popular SDRs.  Note that this process is done entirely outside of IQEngine.  Once you have a SigMF recording, you can then open it in IQEngine for analysis.

The following steps were tested to work under Ubuntu 22.  Feel free to update this doc by editing https://github.com/IQEngine/IQEngine/blob/main/client/src/pages/docs/record-from-sdr.mdx

## Example SigMF Meta File

For each SDR below, you can make the metafile by creating a new text file called `recording.sigmf-meta` and populate it with the following minimal example.  You will have to update datatype, sample_rate, and frequency.

```json
{
    "global": {
        "core:datatype": "cf32_le",
        "core:sample_rate": 1000000,
        "core:hw": "Info about your SDR here",
        "core:author": "Your name",
        "core:version": "1.0.0"
    },
    "captures": [
        {
            "core:sample_start": 0,
            "core:frequency": 915000000
        }
    ],
    "annotations": []
}
```

## RTL-SDR

```bash
sudo apt install rtl-sdr
rtl_sdr -f 915e6 -s 2048e3 -n 1e6 recording.sigmf-data
```

f is center freq, s is sample rate, n is number of samples, run just `rtl_sdr` for more options/info

Create a the SigMF metafile using the above example and `cu8_le` for core:datatype

## USRP

Should work for B200, B210, X310, etc

```bash
sudo apt install uhd-host
cd /usr/lib/uhd/examples
rx_samples_to_file --freq 915e6 --rate 1e6 --type float --nsamps 1e6 --file recording.sigmf-data
```

For `--type float` you'll want a datatype of cf32_le.  See `rx_samples_to_file  --help` for more info.  Adding the num_recv_frames arg and setting it high can help reduce overflows.

## PlutoSDR (aka ADALM-PLUTO)

Follow these instructions to get the library and Python package working https://pysdr.org/content/pluto.html

Then run the Python code

```python
import adi
sdr = adi.Pluto('ip:192.168.2.1') # or whatever your Pluto's IP is
sdr.sample_rate = int(1e6)
sdr.gain_control_mode_chan0 = 'manual'
sdr.rx_hardwaregain_chan0 = 70.0 # dB
sdr.rx_lo = int(915e6)
sdr.rx_buffer_size = 1e6 # number of samples to receive
samples = sdr.rx() # receive samples off Pluto
samples = samples.astype(np.complex64)
samples.tofile('recording.sigmf-data') # save to binary IQ file
```

then use cf32_le in your metafile

Alternatively you might be able to:

```bash
sudo apt install libiio-dev libad9361-dev
sudo pip install pyadi-iio
```

Then run the Python code to receive and save to file.
